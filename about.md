I am a software developer, engineer and triathlete living in Austin, Texas. I went to college at the Colorado School of Mines where I obtained a B.S. in Geophysical Engineering. After graduating I moved to San Luis Obispo, California where I worked for the tech company MINDBODY, Inc. I spent 6 months learning about their sales cycle as a Sales Development Representative. I then moved to their Onboarding Department where I was responsible for teaching business owners how to successfully implement the MINDBODY software to run their business. The clients I worked with were from all over the world, mostly Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. The year I was at MINDBODY was instrumental in teaching me about company to client relationships and software implementation for SaaS companies. However, I wanted more.

I knew that to be truly happy in my job and continue my career, I needed to be on the development side of the industry. In June of 2017, I packed up my trusty van with all my belongings and said goodbye to the Central Coast and headed to the land of BBQ, cowboy boots and blue open skies: Austin, Texas. Upon arriving in Austin I started an online coding bootcamp specifically for software development through Bloc. This website will serve as my project portfolio as well as a way to learn more about me and my non-coding related hobbies!
