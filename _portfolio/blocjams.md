## Explanation

BlocJams was a school project I completed through Bloc. The purpose was to gain familiarity in front-end development using HTML, CSS, JS and the Buzz Library. Resources were provided by Bloc to help me through the project, but the project was completed in its entirety by myself. The project was to make a digitial music player similar to popular music players like Spotify or Pandora.

## Problem

This project started from scratch. Every single HTML, CSS and JS file was created and written by myself. Instructions, MP3 files and .jpg images were provided by Bloc for my use.

## Solution

This project was completed using vanilla javascript. Once I created the basic html pages and styled them with their corresponding css files to match the given assignment, I created the JS files. The javascript files primarily corresponded to the music playing features. Files were created so that the web page had responsive play/pause buttons and time/volume seek bars.

## Results

The project was successfully completed, showing that vanilla javascript is capable of creating complex and interactive web pages. Despite my best efforts to write code as abstract as possible, there was a significant amount of lines of code. This was helped by the implementation of the jquery library but could be improved further by using the angular framework instead.

## Conclusion

If you have a simple to moderately complex web page, vanilla javascript is an absolutely viable means of design.
