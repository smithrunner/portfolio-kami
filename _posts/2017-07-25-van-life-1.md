title: Van Life Part 1
---

Rain pitter-pattered on the metal roof. A sea of blankets engulfed me as I clung to my book to keep my brain afloat. The ancient redwood giants looked over me and my trusty van as my brain wondered into a deep sleep.

Living in a van in California is everything it is chalked up to be... and everything it isn't. The 4 months I spent living out of my van on the central coast of California were the most influential and motivating months of my life. It was a period of time that saw me transition from a sales role into an onboarding position at the large tech company: MINDBODY. It is the period of time that I decided to embrace every opportunity that I came across, in my personal and professional life.

Many job applications, miles, hikes, trail runs and Chipotle burritos later I found myself packing up my trusty van once more to drive across the country for a new opportunity and a new beginning. In the span of 10 days I had gone from being fully employed in California to being a full time software engineering student and part time Lyft/Uber driver in Austin, Texas.

These blog posts will be a mixture of my experiences living in a van and stories of my current adventure in Austin to become a software developer.

Enjoy.
